Todo List App

This is a Todo List application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The project does not use any frameworks and focuses on clean structure and simple logic.

Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and restore deleted items using an undo button. The app also supports search and filtering (all, completed, incomplete) to help manage large task lists.

Tasks and theme settings are saved in LocalStorage, so all data is preserved after page reload. The interface includes light and dark themes, a modal window for creating tasks, and a fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.

This project was created as a portfolio example to practice frontend development with pure JavaScript.

The design is based on a Figma Community template and is licensed under CC BY 4.0.
